### Statement
**How might college students aged 16-24 develop a low-cost meal planning and grocery shopping strategy so that they can minimize expenses, reduce food waste and practice sustainable living?**

### Context
There are many conflicts that college students face within their new environment. One of the biggest ones includes food. Students are unsure how to cook food, buy new ingredients, and most importantly they waste a lot of food within this process. Unfortunately, as of yet, very little has materialized within this space that can provide college students a method or solution to overcome this problem with working with ingredients. This problem overtime, will then also increase pollution and contributes to the growing problem of food waste. As per statistics, food waste is rapidly-decaying, nutrient-dense material that accounts for about 15% of the total municipal solid waste stream. The goal is to provide college students an answer to help find recipes from the ingredients they already have.

Pantry Pals aims to address the issue of food waste by providing a way that not only helps college students find recipes and make a better use of their existing ingredients but to help track their food waste and learn how to reduce it. By giving users more food opportunities and a meal planning feature, Pantry Pals empowers students to be more mindful of their food choices, budgeting, and impact on the world.
